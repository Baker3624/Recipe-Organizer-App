# Recipe Organizer App

## Project Description
The Recipe Organizer App is designed to simplify the process of managing and accessing recipes. Users can save recipes from various sources, including websites, friends, and family, or input their own. The app allows for easy organization of recipes, enabling users to sort them alphabetically or by the date they were saved. Additionally, users can create shopping lists directly from recipes, streamlining their grocery shopping experience.

## Problem Addressing
The app addresses the common problem of forgetting or misplacing recipes, often written down in books that can become damaged or lost over time. By providing a digital platform accessible on smart devices, users can securely store and access their recipes anytime, anywhere. This eliminates the need for manual transcription or searching through physical recipe collections.

## Platform
The Recipe Organizer App will be available as a mobile application specifically developed for Android devices, ensuring accessibility to a wide user base.

# Recipe-Organizer-App
Project description
The app that I will be developing is a recipe organizer that allows users to save recipes from websites, friends, and family, or enter their own. This app will also allow users to organize recipes in alphabetical order or by the date it was saved. Users will be able to search for the name of a recipe to save time from scanning through an entire list. What makes this app unique is that users will be able to create a shopping list of the ingredients they need. 
Problem addressing
The problem that this app will be addressing is people forgetting recipes or having them written down in a book. A recipe book can get damaged, fade, or fill up over time, so the need for another recipe book to rewrite recipes can be time-consuming. Almost everyone has a smart device today, so with this app, they will be able to save recipes they find, get from others, or come up with themselves. 
Platform
The platform will be a mobile application for Android devices.
Front/Back End
On the front end, there will be an intuitive design that allows for seamless navigation, a responsive layout for various screen sizes and different orientations, and user user-friendly that allows users to easily navigate.
On the back end, storage of user-generated content such as shopping lists and recipes, security measures that will ensure user data is safe, and efficient data processing to ensure the app runs smoothly.
